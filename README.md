## My Interests:>
- I'm a computer science undergrad and a fresher(2022 passout).
- Learning React or Angular along with a backend technology is my main interest for this semester. 
- I love playing sports and I'm very much intrested in activities like swimming, hiking etc

## Technical Background
Being a computer science undergraduate gave me an opportunity to learn some of the programming languages like C, C++, Java, python.
Other than the academic stuff, I've done some online courses in Machine learning( Tensor flow)...
I was very much influenced by Hadoop in my Big Data sessions even though all i know for now is just the basics.
